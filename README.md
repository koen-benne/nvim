# vim-config

Use [this](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/JetBrainsMono/NoLigatures/Regular/complete/JetBrains%20Mono%20NL%20Regular%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono.ttf) font as the terminal font.

Make sure ripgrep and lazygit are installed.
Also there is no proper installation thing so PackerSync once or twice and it'll work I think
